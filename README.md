# Search-tabs

## Description
It is an extension that let's your search tabs in telescope.nvim like manner.

## Why
I just really like firefox, browsing and wanted to make my experience more nicer. Since I am using a lot of nvim keybings and features, I thought that it would be a good idea to implement something like telescope.nvim (not really I know)

## Future
- [ ]  Make nice UI
- [ ]  Implement preview of tab when it is picked
- [ ]  Explore new ways to impelemnt UI of search
- [ ]  Impelement search by url
- [ ]  Make it configurable from UI with json
- [ ]  Implement nice logging of errors
- [ ]  Clean up code from bad logs and TODOs
- [ ]  Impelemnt more complex engine search
- [ ]  Packed extension into firefox add-on store
- [ ]  Implement more features with buffers and switching from nvim

It is a temporary name, when I will think of something better need to rename the project.
